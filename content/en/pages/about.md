Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
This blog is where I share my journey in tech, along with thoughts about my passions and whatever else crosses my mind.
Starting a blog has been on my list for a long time — I had ideas, half-written drafts, but never enough time or the confidence in my writing to follow through.
With AI tools now making some things easier, maybe it's the right moment to finally give it a real shot.
Still, the posts here are personal: they take time, a lot of edits, and more effort than it might seem.
Hopefully, this will grow into something more than just another forgotten project.

# Who Am I?
I've been working as a software engineer for about 10 years now.
It was never really a big passion, but with the right project and company, I actually enjoy my job now.
Most of the time I work on backend stuff in the Java world, but I also do some frontend when needed, even if it's not really my thing.
I'm also interested in ops and I like using Python when I need to build tools or small projects.

Outside of work, I get easily hooked on a lot of different things like painting, reading about anything that grabs my attention, films and cinema, and Japan, especially its history and culture.
I'm also not really into games and I'm not a big fan of sci-fi.

# My Professional Journey

I started working in 2014 while I was still in school, on a startup project (not mine) that was supposed to revolutionize the world of electronic design.
It was a great experience where you had to do pretty much everything yourself.
The startup ended up failing, but I learned a lot, and probably the most important lesson was that success isn't just about having a good or bad idea, it's about how good you are at making it happen.

After that, I moved on to work for a PSP and started learning about the banking world.
There was a lot to discover, but everything moved incredibly slow.
You couldn't just fix or improve things, there was always a full process to follow, which seemed normal to everyone around me, but was a big shock coming from a startup background.
And honestly, working at a PSP wasn't even the slowest — things get even worse when you work directly for a bank.
At least I got a fun story out of it: I once broke production and triggered a full war room because of something I did.

Later, I had a few more experiences that mostly taught me what I don't want to do, like working for companies that still send compiled class files to clients and think it's normal in 2020, or being stuck on projects with no real impact and no sense of ownership.

Now I'm working at [Malt](https://www.malt.com/) where I mostly deal with money, invoices, payments, and all that serious stuff.
Honestly, working with money suits me — at least I know it's not a fake feature no one cares about.

# Few Things About Me
I tend to have hobbies that aren't really related to my work.
I’m big into reading and I don’t stick to just one genre — I like exploring a variety of topics.
When I travel, I enjoy visiting museums and exploring different kinds of painting. I’ve also developed a thing for colder, northern countries (I don't know, they just seem to suit me). If you’re ever in Norway, make sure to check out [Edvard Munch's museum](https://www.munchmuseet.no/en/) — his work has a way of staying with you.

I’m also a huge film buff. In fact, I’ve watched at least one movie from over [160 countries](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls051185087), which is about 80% of all countries in the world.
And while most people might find them boring, I enjoy films that others might shy away from. For example, have you ever tried watching [Satantango](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/), a 7-hour slow movie? I absolutely loved it.

When it comes to Japan, I’m a big fan, but not for the usual anime and manga reasons (although I like those too).
In fact, many people I know don’t even recognize the anime or manga titles I enjoy.
What really fascinates me about Japan is its traditional cultures and history — that’s where my real interest lies.
